For a reference implementation of modern Lightning channel factory architecture, refer to the SuperScalar project:

https://github.com/8144225309/SuperScalar

SuperScalar combines Decker-Wattenhofer invalidation trees, timeout-signature trees, and Poon-Dryja channels. No soft fork needed. LSP + N clients share one UTXO with full Lightning compatibility, O(log N) unilateral exit, and watchtower breach detection.
